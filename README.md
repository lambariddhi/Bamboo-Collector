# Bamboo-Collector

This project was created in July of 2023 during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program by Riddhi Lamba. It was originally designed to be run on Repl.it using the p5.js library.

You can play the game here: https://collection-style-game-riddhi-l--riddhil.repl.co/.

Please check out the "Bamboo-Collector" directory for all the code and assets used to create the game. You can also find a demo of the game in the "Bamboo Collector.mp4" file.
